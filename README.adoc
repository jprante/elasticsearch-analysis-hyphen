This plugin for Elasticsearch can handle hyphens and other symbols in words or at word boundaries for improved search precision.

An example in english is the word `editor-in-chief`, which will be indexed as `editor-in-chief` plus `editor`, `in`, `chief`.

In other languages such as german, hyphenated words are much more common ("Bindestrichwörter").

This plugin also helps when analyzing acronyms or symbols in names because the hyphen characters is
configurable by the symbols that connect parts of a word. Also, keywords may be optionally respected.
So it is possible to index `Programming in C++` differently from `Programming in C`
